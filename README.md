# üß† Multimodal Q&A Assistant

This is a multi-page Streamlit application that allows you to build a persistent knowledge base by uploading various media types or adding YouTube links. You can then ask questions about the ingested content using Google's Gemini AI.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps precisely to get the application running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites (Crucial!)**

This application relies on two external command-line tools that **must be installed on your system** and added to your system's PATH.

1.  **Tesseract-OCR:** Required for extracting text from images.
    * **Install:** Download and install from the [official Windows installer](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
    * **Set Path:**
        * After installation (e.g., to `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`), you must add this folder to your system's **Environment Variables PATH**. 
        * You must also update the path in `file_processing.py` to point to your `tesseract.exe`:
            ```python
            pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
            ```

2.  **FFmpeg:** Required by `pydub` and `moviepy` for processing all audio and video files (MP3, MP4, etc.).
    * **Install:** Download the latest "essentials" build from [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
    * **Set Path:**
        * Create a folder like `C:\ffmpeg` and extract the contents there.
        * Add the `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to your system's **Environment Variables PATH**.
    * **Verify:** Open a new command prompt and type `ffmpeg -version`. You should see the version information, not an error.

### **Installation Steps**

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/multimodal-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/multimodal-project.git)
cd multimodal-project
```bash
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv vir

# Activate it (on Windows)
.\vir\Scripts\activate
3. Install Python Packages Create a requirements.txt file with the contents below, then run pip install -r requirements.txt.

<details> <summary>Click to see <strong>requirements.txt</strong></summary>

Plaintext

streamlit
google-generativeai
pytesseract
PyPDF2
python-docx
Pillow
SpeechRecognition
pydub
pandas
openpyxl
xlrd
moviepy
yt-dlp
</details>

Bash

# Install all packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Your API Key This project uses Streamlit's built-in secrets management.

Create a folder named .streamlit in the main project directory.

Inside that folder, create a file named secrets.toml.

Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:

Ini, TOML

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_key_here"
5. Update Your .gitignore Create a .gitignore file in your main project folder to protect your secrets and avoid uploading unnecessary files.

Plaintext

# .gitignore

# Virtual Environment
vir/

# Python cache
__pycache__/

# Streamlit secrets
.streamlit/secrets.toml

# Database
extracted_data.db
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run the App
With your virtual environment activated, run the following command in your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
Streamlit will open the application in your default web browser.

Usage
